# Collection of different python scripts
In this repository I will put all small python scripts for which it is not useful to create a complete separate repository

## dataframe_onehotencoder.py
This script is a simple wrapper around multiple sklearn onehotencoders in a dataframe, where the names of the features after the run are set automatically.

For more information, please see TODO
